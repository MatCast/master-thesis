@article{Farinotti2017,
	abstract = {Knowledge of the ice thickness distribution of glaciers and ice caps is an important prerequisite for many glaciological and hydrological investigations. A wealth of approaches has recently been presented for inferring ice thickness from characteristics of the surface. With the Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison eXperiment (ITMIX) we performed the first coordinated assessment quantifying individual model performance. A set of 17 different models showed that individual ice thickness estimates can differ considerably {\&}ndash; locally by a spread comparable to the observed thickness. Averaging the results of multiple models, however, significantly improved the results: On average over the 21 considered test cases, comparison against direct ice thickness measurements revealed deviations in the order of 10 {\&}pm; 24{\%} of the mean ice thickness (1-sigma estimate). For models relying on multiple data sets -- such as surface ice velocity fields, surface mass balance, or rates of ice thickness change {\&}ndash; the results highlighted the sensitivity to input data consistency. Together with the requirement of being able to handle large regions in an automated fashion, the capacity of better accounting for uncertainties in the input data will be a key for an improved next generation of ice thickness estimation approaches.},

	abstract = {Global warming is an alarming reality and likely leads to  an increase of multiple pressures on socio-economic  systems. However, in high-mountain regions it might also  become an opportunity to adapt existing hydropower schemes  and future projects to this new reality. In the Alps, the  melting of glaciers first produces over the near future an  increase of the average annual discharge depending on  glacier and catchment characteristics, especially during  the summer season. Nevertheless after a certain time,  significant decrease of runoff related to glacier melting  must be considered for hydropower management. Moreover, the  melted glaciers free new alpine valley areas, which have a  potential for the construction of new dams and reservoirs.  The opportunity to build new dams and hydropower plants  downstream of retreating glaciers is studied systematically  in Switzerland within the framework of the National  Research Program on Sustainable Water Management (NRP61)  under the project “New lakes in deglaciating highmountain  areas: climate-related development and challenges for  sustainable use (NELAK)”. The developed methodology is  based on several prediction models. Regional climate models  provide spatially distributed rainfall and temperature  scenarios for the next 50 years. The RS3.0 CLIMATE  rainfall-runoff hydrological model computes the glacier  evolution, the river discharge at the outlet of the  catchment area as well as the hydropower production of the  new lakes. Another model (GlabTop) is used to predict the  future topography and geomorphology underneath the melting  glaciers, in order to define the optimal locations of the  future dams and reservoirs. As a case study the  Corbassière glacier near the Mauvoisin reservoir in Valais  is presented. The opportunity of the construction of a new  dam and a hydropower plant is studied, as well as its  economic benefit and its impacts on the environment. The  result of the case study provides a basis to assess the  potential of investing in such projects to ensure the Swiss  hydroelectricity production also in future.},

@article{RandomHo1995,
	abstract = {Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

This paper presents support vector machines (SVM), a new neural network algorithm, to forecast building energy consumption in the tropical region. The objective of this paper is to examine the feasibility and applicability of SVM in building load forecasting area. Four commercial buildings in Singapore are selected randomly as case studies. Weather data including monthly mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature (T0), relative humidity (RH) and global solar radiation (GSR) are taken as three input features. Mean monthly landlord utility bills are collected for developing and testing models. In addition, the performance of SVM with respect to two parameters, C and $\epsilon$, was explored using stepwise searching method based on radial-basis function (RBF) kernel. Finally, all prediction results are found to have coefficients of variance (CV) less than 3{\%} and percentage error ({\%}error) within 4{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.
