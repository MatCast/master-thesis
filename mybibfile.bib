@article{Farinotti2017,
	abstract = {Knowledge of the ice thickness distribution of glaciers and ice caps is an important prerequisite for many glaciological and hydrological investigations. A wealth of approaches has recently been presented for inferring ice thickness from characteristics of the surface. With the Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison eXperiment (ITMIX) we performed the first coordinated assessment quantifying individual model performance. A set of 17 different models showed that individual ice thickness estimates can differ considerably {\&}ndash; locally by a spread comparable to the observed thickness. Averaging the results of multiple models, however, significantly improved the results: On average over the 21 considered test cases, comparison against direct ice thickness measurements revealed deviations in the order of 10 {\&}pm; 24{\%} of the mean ice thickness (1-sigma estimate). For models relying on multiple data sets -- such as surface ice velocity fields, surface mass balance, or rates of ice thickness change {\&}ndash; the results highlighted the sensitivity to input data consistency. Together with the requirement of being able to handle large regions in an automated fashion, the capacity of better accounting for uncertainties in the input data will be a key for an improved next generation of ice thickness estimation approaches.},

	abstract = {Global warming is an alarming reality and likely leads to  an increase of multiple pressures on socio-economic  systems. However, in high-mountain regions it might also  become an opportunity to adapt existing hydropower schemes  and future projects to this new reality. In the Alps, the  melting of glaciers first produces over the near future an  increase of the average annual discharge depending on  glacier and catchment characteristics, especially during  the summer season. Nevertheless after a certain time,  significant decrease of runoff related to glacier melting  must be considered for hydropower management. Moreover, the  melted glaciers free new alpine valley areas, which have a  potential for the construction of new dams and reservoirs.  The opportunity to build new dams and hydropower plants  downstream of retreating glaciers is studied systematically  in Switzerland within the framework of the National  Research Program on Sustainable Water Management (NRP61)  under the project “New lakes in deglaciating highmountain  areas: climate-related development and challenges for  sustainable use (NELAK)”. The developed methodology is  based on several prediction models. Regional climate models  provide spatially distributed rainfall and temperature  scenarios for the next 50 years. The RS3.0 CLIMATE  rainfall-runoff hydrological model computes the glacier  evolution, the river discharge at the outlet of the  catchment area as well as the hydropower production of the  new lakes. Another model (GlabTop) is used to predict the  future topography and geomorphology underneath the melting  glaciers, in order to define the optimal locations of the  future dams and reservoirs. As a case study the  Corbassière glacier near the Mauvoisin reservoir in Valais  is presented. The opportunity of the construction of a new  dam and a hydropower plant is studied, as well as its  economic benefit and its impacts on the environment. The  result of the case study provides a basis to assess the  potential of investing in such projects to ensure the Swiss  hydroelectricity production also in future.},

But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

Weather data including monthly mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature (T0), relative humidity (RH) and global solar radiation (GSR) are taken as three input features. Mean monthly landlord utility bills are collected for developing and testing models. In addition, the performance of SVM with respect to two parameters, C and $\epsilon$, was explored using stepwise searching method based on radial-basis function (RBF) kernel.

@article{RandomFBias2007,
	abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Nye1965,
	abstract = { Numerical solutions are found for the steady rectilinear flow of ice, obeying Glen's non-linear flow law, down uniform cylindrical channels of rectangular, semi-elliptic and parabolic cross-section. The results are also directly applicable to the pumping of a non-Newtonian fluid down a pipe. There is assumed to be no slip of the ice on the channel surface. Certain results on the centre-line velocity in symmetrical channels may be derived purely from dimensional and symmetry principles. An analytical solution due to Dr. W. Chester is given for a semi-elliptic channel section which departs only slightly from a semi-circle. Contrary to a view sometimes held, the maximum shear stress at the ice surface in a parabolic channel and in some elliptical channels does not always occur at the edge. With the flow law, strain-rate proportional to (stress) 3 , the velocity averaged across the ice surface, which is easily measured with a line of stakes, is close to the average velocity over the whole section for a wide range of parabolic sections; the hydrological importance of this result is that the discharge may be inferred without the need to measure the velocity at depth. Arguments are given to show that the result still holds when there is slipping on the bed and when the power in the flow law differs somewhat from 3, Depending on the amount of bed slip and the shape of the channel section, the kinematic wave velocity for a range of parabolic channels is between 2.0 and 2.3 times the centre-line velocity of the ice, and between 2.0 and 3.5 times the mean surface velocity of the ice.

Les r{\'{e}}sultats sont aussi directement applicables au pompage d'un fluide non newtonien {\`{a}} travers une conduite. Il est suppos{\'{e}} que la glace ne glisse pas {\`{a}} la surface du canal. Certains r{\'{e}}sultats de la vitesse de la ligne centrale peuvent {\'{e}}tre d{\'{e}}duits des consid{\'{e}}rations de dimension et de sym{\'{e}}trie. Une solution analytique du Dr. W.

Contrairement {\`{a}} une opinion {\'{e}}nonc{\'{e}}e parfois, le maximum de la tension de cisaillement dans un canal parabolique ou elliptique ne se manifeste pas toujours sur le bord pour la surface de la glace. Avec la loi d'{\'{e}}coulement, vitesse de d{\'{e}}formation proportionnelle au cube de la contrainte, la moyenne de la vitesse superficielle le long d'un profil transversal, facilement mesur{\'{e}}e par une ligne de balises, est proche de la vitesse moyenne pour toute la section pour bien des sections paraboliques; une conclusion hydrologique importante en d{\'{e}}coule, {\`{a}} savoir que le d{\'{e}}bit peut {\'{e}}tre obtenu sans mesure des vitesses profondes. Des arguments sont pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}}s pour montrer que ces r{\'{e}}sultats sont valables m{\'{e}}me lorsqu'il y a glissement sur le lit et lorsque la puissance de la loi d'{\'{e}}coulement diff{\`{e}}re quelque peu de trois. D{\'{e}}pendant du glissement sur le lit et de la forme de la section du canal, la vitesse dc la vague cin{\'{e}}matique pour un ensemble de sections paraboliques est comprise entre 2,0 et 2,3 fois la vitesse de la ligne centrale de la glace, et entre 2,0 et 3,5 fois la vitesse moyenne superficielle.F{\"{u}}r das stetige, geradlinige Fliessen von Eis nach Glen's nichtlinearem Fliessgesetz in gleichf{\"{o}}rmigen zylindrischen Betten mit rechteckigem, halbelliptisehem und parabolischem Querschnitt werden numerische L{\"{o}}sungen gegeben.

@article{Clarke2009,
	abstract = {To predict the rate and consequences of shrinkage of the earth's mountain glaciers and ice caps, it is necessary to have improved regional-scale models of mountain glaciation and better knowledge of the subglacial topography upon which these models must operate. The problem of estimating glacier ice thickness is addressed by developing an artificial neural network ( ANN) approach that uses calculations performed on a digital elevation model (DEM) and on a mask of the present-day ice cover. Because suitable data from real glaciers are lacking, the ANN is trained by substituting the known topography of ice-denuded regions adjacent to the ice-covered regions of interest, and this known topography is hidden by imagining it to be ice-covered. For this training it is assumed that the topography is flooded to various levels by horizontal lake-like glaciers. The validity of this assumption and the estimation skill of the trained ANN is tested by predicting ice thickness for four 50 km x 50 km regions that are currently ice free but that have been partially glaciated using a numerical ice dynamics model. In this manner, predictions of ice thickness based on the neural network can be compared to the modeled ice thickness and the performance of the neural network can be evaluated and improved. From the results, thus far, it is found that ANN depth estimates can yield plausible subglacial topography with a representative rms elevation error of +/- 70 m and remarkably good estimates of ice volume.},

	abstract = {A new physically based approach for calculating glacier ice thickness distribution and volume is presented and applied to all glaciers and ice caps worldwide. Combining glacier outlines of the globally complete Randolph Glacier Inventory with terrain elevation models (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission/Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), we use a simple dynamic model to obtain spatially distributed thickness of individual glaciers by inverting their surface topography. Results are validated against a comprehensive set of thickness observations for 300 glaciers from most glacierized regions of the world. For all mountain glaciers and ice caps outside of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets we find a total ice volume of 170 × 103 ± 21 × 103 km3, or 0.43 ± 0.06 m of potential sea level rise.},
