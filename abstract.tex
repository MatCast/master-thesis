Correctly estimating the volume of glaciers is essential to accurately predict future in sea level change and water availability. To compute the volume of a glacier, an estimate of its thickness distribution is needed. Ice thickness measurements are sparse and spatially incomplete. Numerical and statistical modeling therefore is necessary to estimate the full ice thickness distribution. Recently, the Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison eXperiment (ITMIX) evaluated the accuracy of 17 ice thickness estimation models. 15 of those models rely on glacier physics and numerical modeling in order to estimate the ice thickness distribution. Because data was so sparse, statistical models trained with ice thickness observations have not been used extensively by the glaciological community. The recent publication of the Glacier Thickness Database (GlaThiDa), a data-set aiming at collecting all glacier ice thickness observations worldwide, and the advancement in the field of machine learning, opened up to the possibility of a glacier ice thickness estimation model based on machine learning algorithms. 

In this thesis, three different machine learning algorithms have been trained using ice thickness observations from the GlaThiDa for glaciers in the Alps. Linear regression, random forest regression and support vector regression have been used to create models to estimate glaciers ice thickness from surface data such as: altitude above sea level, distance from the glacier border, slope angle and mass balance. Parts of the ice thickness observations have been used to train the models and other parts to test their accuracy. With this cross-validation method, 20 different samples have been created to train and test the models. The highest R2 coefficient has been registered by the support vector machine, with an average R2 = 0.55 across the different samples. The algorithms tuned with a cross validation process have then been trained using all the available ice thickness observations for glaciers in the alps. With this training method, the highest R2 = 0.57 has been registered for the random forest regression, which could however be subject to bias towards the data used for training it. 

The three models trained using all the available observations, have then been used to estimate the total volume of glaciers in the alps. The results have been compared to the findings from Farinotti et al. (2019), who estimated the volume of glaciers globally using five established physically based models. Comparing the ice volume for glaciers in the Alps, the linear regression model predicted a total volume 9.8\% larger than the reference estimate. The random forest regression a volume 22.1\% lower and the support vector machine a volume 25.1\% lower. The last two models have been found unable to correctly estimate ice thicknesses for large glaciers in the Alps. The results indicate that the machine learning algorithms trained in this thesis are not fit to estimate large ice thickness values for the alpine region. Further work could be done by training the models with different input data such as climate data and a mass balance taking into account the catchment basins of the glacier. Training the models with data from other regions could also lead to better performances. The availability of ice thickness observations covering a wider spectrum of glaciers, and particularly large glaciers, could result in the biggest improvement in the models accuracy, and is a point to take into account when organizing future campaigns to collect ice thickness measurements.
