\section{Machine Learning models comparison}\label{MLcomp}

\subsection{Score comparison}
How well do the models predict values in the test dataset and how do the models compare with each other.

\subsection{Spread Comparison}
How much spread can we expect across different slpits between train and test data for all the model.

\subsection{Feature importance comparison}
Do different models give more importance to different features when making predictions?

\section{Alps volume comparison}\label{Alpscomp}
How do the predicted volumes for the whole alps from the machine learning models compare to the volumes predicted by some physical based models.

%The discussion is the interpretation and evaluation of the results. It is a
%comparison of your results with previous findings. It provides the answer to the
%scientific questions raised in the introduction. It is the ``nerve center'' of a
%thesis, whereas the chapter Results may be seen as the ``heart''.
%
%Clearly separate between your own contributions and those of others. Provide
%rigorous citations of appropriate sources! Explicitly refer to specific results
%presented earlier. A certain amount of repetition is necessary. For
%example, the results presented in \ref{3sec:2} suggest that \dots. Order
%discussion items not chronologically but rather logically.
%
%The chapter Results answers the question: \emph{What} has been
%found? (Facts). The chapter Discussion answers the question: \emph{How} has the
%result to be interpreted? (Opinion).
%
%The most important message should appear in the first paragraph. The answer to
%the key question may appear in the first sentence: e.g., did your original idea
%work, or didn't it? The following questions may be answered in the discussion
%section:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Why is the presented method simpler, better, more reliable than previous
%ones?
%\item What are its strengths and its limitations?
%\item How significant are the results?
%\item How trustworthy are the observations?
%\item Under which precondition/assumption and for which region are the
%results/method valid?
%\item Can the results be easily transferred to other regions or fields?
%\end{itemize}
